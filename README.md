# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

I really wanted to learn how to create HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a website. I decided to go-back to school and learn Full Stack development. I built this project to showcase my skills I learned throughout my prework. I learned how to create repositories, branches on Github, how to create local saves on my computer and how to merge those saves to the main branch on Github. It was fun learning how to code HTML and create a webpage.
